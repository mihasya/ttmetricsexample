This is a very concise example of a
[Tigertonic](https://github.com/rcrowley/go-tigertonic) service. The `basic`
version is just the bare bones of a service; the `instrumented` version is the
exact same thing, but with some metrics added.

The purpose of this code is to illustrate how easy it is to add various
instrumentation to a Tigertonic service while maintaining very good separation
of concerns.

I wrote this code for a blog entry, which will be linked once it's published.
